HTML, for HyperText Markup Language, is a declarative language used for creating and visually representing a webpage. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages.
 
HTML is a subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and is specified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

```html

<!--  Comments are between arrows. -->

<!--  HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of
      tags enclosed in angle brackets : <tag>. -->
  
<!-- <!DOCTYPE> informs the browser which version of HTML you used. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
  
<!--  Always start with the tag <html>. It represents the root of an HTML document. -->
<html>
<!--  An HTML page is divide in two parts.
      The first one, <head>, provides general information about the document.
      The second one, <body>, represents the content of an HTML document.
      They are both single. -->
  <head>
    <title>Here we write the Document title</title>
    <!-- A lot of metadata tags exist.  -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Here we write the Document content -->
  </body>
  <!-- Never forget to close your tag! -->
</html>
